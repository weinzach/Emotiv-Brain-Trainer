# Emotiv-Brain-Trainer
A hackathon project to merge the Emotiv Epoc+ with the pyBrain machine learning. The project is designed to work with the Emotiv Community SDK which can be found [here](https://github.com/Emotiv/community-sdk).
 The script contains all the necessary functions to train the neural network using the data given from the headset while being easy and simple to use.
